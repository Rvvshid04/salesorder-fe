# Project Submission – Raashid

This submission contains the frontend and backend structure for the task.

Due to limited familiarity with .NET Core, Clean Architecture, and SQL Server setup within the given time, the backend implementation is not fully functional yet. However, I have set up the project structure, layers, and the initial approach I intended to follow.

**What is included:**
- Clean Architecture layout (API / Application / Domain / Infrastructure)
- Initial model and controller stubs
- DbContext setup (incomplete)
- Frontend components and UI layout

**What remains:**
- Database integration
- Repository + service implementations
- Completed API endpoints

I’m happy to walk through the structure, thought process, and how I would complete the remaining parts.
