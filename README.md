# Project Submission – Raashid

This submission contains the frontend and backend structure for the task.

Due to limited familiarity with .NET Core, Clean Architecture, and SQL Server setup within the given time, the backend implementation is not fully functional yet. However, I have set up the project structure, layers, and the initial approach I intended to follow.

**What is included:**
- Clean Architecture layout (API / Application / Domain / Infrastructure)
- DbContext setup (incomplete)
- Frontend components and UI layout
- Repository + service implementations

**What remains:**
- Database integration
- API functionality
